what is an LLC? joint partnership?

FBN and DBA are the same thing

_moshez: 'also, yeah, what dreid said. if instead of offering, say, contracting services under your own name, you want to look like a big corporate entity, you file for a DBA as "Super serious corporate programmers". much cheaper, and easier on your taxes, than actually creating a business called "Super serious corporate programmers".'
